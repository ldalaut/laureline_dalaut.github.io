        I'm a research scientist in marine ecosystem modelling.
        Having specialised in marine ecology, I have gained experience in industry, research and teaching. My activities cover a wide range of areas, reflecting my desire for multidisciplinarity and overall scientific progress.

        - Research in marine ecology and ecosystem modelling 🐠
        - Mechanical engineering ⚙️
        - Scientific mediation 🗣️
        - Environmental analysis of projects and products 🌏
        - Project management 📑

        I am convinced that progress in the future will only be achieved by promoting interactions between science and society. Promoting research is a key issue at present and one that should not be overlooked!
